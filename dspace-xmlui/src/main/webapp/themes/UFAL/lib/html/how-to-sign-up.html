        We are very glad that you are using our services and that you want to further the experience by obtaining an
        account. There are basically two paths possible, the preferred and more convenient for both you and us is
        logging with an institutional account. Below there's an overview of the institutional logins and local logins;
        both with directions how to obtain the account.

                With institutional logins you are de facto logging to a familiar page of your home institution and you
                are using credentials you already remember. The full procedure is bit more complicated - you initiate
                the login at our service, you are redirected to your institution and only after successfully logging
                there you are redirected back. Your insitution acts like a sort of a proxy for the multitude of services
                available in all the CLARIN Centres.

                In case your institution is not listed (but please try searching all the available countries and maybe
                also using the english name of your institution) the preffered approach is to create an account with <a
                    href="https://user.clarin.eu/user/register" class="bold">CLARIN</a>. After you obtain your account,
                proceed to login with institution called "Clarin.eu website account".

        <p>When you click a logout button in any of our applications you are logged out from that application only; the
            sp session and idp session are still active. In practice this means when you try to log in again you might
            not be able to select an idp (the one you've used the last time is remembered) or you might not be asked to
            enter username/password on your idp page (if you select the same idp, the idp remembers you for some time).
            You can get more information about why single logout is hard at <a
