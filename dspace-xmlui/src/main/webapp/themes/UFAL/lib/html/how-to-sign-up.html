            We are very glad that you are using our services and that you want to further the experience by obtaining an
            account. There are basically two paths possible, the preferred and more convenient for both you and us is
            logging with an institutional account. Below there's an overview of the institutional logins and local
            logins; both with directions how to obtain the account.

                    With institutional logins you are de facto logging to a familiar page of your home institution and
                    you are using credentials you already remember. The full procedure is bit more complicated - you
                    initiate the login at our service, you are redirected to your institution and only after
                    successfully logging there you are redirected back. Your insitution acts like a sort of a proxy for
                    the multitude of services available in all the CLARIN Centres.

                    maybe also using the english name of your institution) the preffered approach is to create an
                    account with <a href="https://user.clarin.eu/user/register" class="bold">CLARIN</a>. After you
                    obtain your account, proceed to login with institution called "Clarin.eu website account".

                    With a local account you will gain access to only one service, the one you've asked for. When you
                    discover a different service in our infrastructure you'll need to ask again and again. The same goes
                    for services in <a href="http://clarin.eu" class="bold">other eu countries</a> - you'll need to ask
                    and ask and ask. Now it might not seem as that much when you think only one service, but when you
                    think the whole infrastructure it means remembering login/password combination for each of these
                    services. If you are convinced that this is what you need or have some other reason for wanting a
                    local account please <span id="cloak2ff741263951b64cb0902fe5706d0f03"><a

                In order to allow access from all over the world, LINDAT/CLARIN service provider is a member of several
                identity federations including <a href="http://www.clarin.eu/content/service-provider-federation"
                                                  class="bold">CLARIN SPF</a> and <a
                    href="http://www.geant.net/service/eduGAIN/Pages/home.aspx" class="bold">eduGAIN</a>. Unfortunately,
                some of these federations include identity providers who do not guarantee their users to be real people
                (e.g., you can trace the account to an email but not to a person). We try to keep our services as open
                as possible but there are cases (e.g., signing licenses in our repository) where anonymous users are
                forbidden.
            </p>
            <p>
                For that reason we choose to exclude users from test IdPs and from IdPs that let you create your
                accounts online with no further background check.

                might not be able to select an idp (the one you've used the last time is remembered) or you might not be
                asked to enter username/password on your idp page (if you select the same idp, the idp remembers you for
                some time). You can get more information about why single logout is hard at <a
